drop table if exists cars;
create table cars

	model_id		int primary key,
	model_name		varchar(100),
	color			varchar(100),
	brand			varchar(100)
);
insert into cars values(1,'Leaf', 'Black', 'Nissan');
insert into cars values(2,'Leaf', 'Black', 'Nissan');

select * from cars;


delete from cars
where model_id  not in(
select min(model_id)
